Vision, in general, involves a *lot* of unconscious pattern recognition. If we can harness that power, we can show people data in a way that doesn't require a lot of thought for them to engage with the data.

## Why Graphics Matter

::: {.large .center}
Graphics are a form of [external cognition]{.emph .cerulean} that allow us to think about the [data]{.emph .red} rather than the [chart]{.emph .gray}

::: notes

This is a famous chart in astronomy - it shows the life cycle of a star, classifying it by its brightness and color. The interesting thing is that it wasn't originally intended to show the life cycle of a star - it was originaly intended to show the relationship between the two - and at the time, it wasn't known that the star's life cycle governed the relationship. But, when you look at the chart, it's very clear that there is a relationship, and stars can take several different paths through the "life cycle" depending on their type. 

Through the rest of this talk, we'll explore some of the features that make the HR diagram (and other good charts) effective.

## Preattentive perception 

- Occurs automatically (no effort)

- Color, shape, angle 

- Combinations of preattentive features require attention
    - Unless you double-encode    
    (use different features for the same variable)


<br/><br/>

::: {.emph .center .cerulean .huge}
Using preattentive features reduces the amount of work your viewer has to expend to understand your chart

## What do you see?

![](IllusoryContour.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes

What do you see here? 3 pac-men shapes and 3 acute angles? No? 

I see 3 circles, a triangle with a black outline, and a white triangle with no outline.  But... that's not really what's there, is it?

I'll talk next about the Gestalt laws, but if you can't remember them, just remember this saying - "The whole is greater than the sum of the parts" - just as here, what we see is more orderly than what is actually there.

:::

## Gestalt Laws of Perception

![](gestalt.jpg){fig-align="center"}

::: notes

The Gestalt laws are a set of rules for how we interpret ambiguity in the visual scene. 

The law of Closure says that it's easier to interpret things if you imagine them as a closed figure - it's more likely that a closed figure is for instance obstructed, than that it is a set of more complex, less meaningful figures. This is sometimes also stated as the "law of good figure"

the law of Proximity says that things that are close together are likely part of the same unit. So you might interpret things as a dalmation instead of a series of blobs of black ink. 

The law of continuation says that figures with edges that are smooth are more likely to be continuous than things with edges that are sharp angles. 

the law of similarity says that things are likely to be viewed as part of a group if they look similar. 

Then, the law of figure/ground helps explain why we see both the tree and the AL figure combination here - we have contextual information that helps us simplify the picture into two groups - the figure (the tree), and the background (the AL); thsi also helps us separate the AL from the white background behind it. 

There are a few other gestalt laws, but these are the main ones.

Now, let's talk about how these laws apply to charts! I swear, I didn't forget that I am supposed to be talking about data visualization.

  mutate(x = map(x, rnorm, n = 100, sd = .75), y = map(y, rnorm, n = 100, sd = .75)) %>%
  unnest(x, y)

nrow = 1)

::: notes

Add annotations to your plots based on what you want to emphasize. If you want to show the trend (or deviations from it), add a line and maybe a confidence band. If you want to show clustering, use ellipses and color and/or shape. 

What you add to the plot helps to determine what people will see in the data!

## Visual Limitations 

::: large

- Not all graphical representations are equally accurate

- Optical illusions 

- Designing plots for disabilities

:::

## Accuracy of Graphical Judgements

1. Position along a common scale (most accurate)
    - scatter plot
2. Position along nonaligned scale
    - multiple scatter plots
3. Length
    - bar chart
4. Angle, Slope
    - pie chart
5. Area
    - bubble chart
6. Volume, Density, Color saturation
    - heatmap
7. Color hue (least accurate)


::: notes

When you design a visualization, try to make the most important variables represented by dimensions that are accurate.

In some cases, we only care about relative accuracy - for those, things like color saturation are fine for encoding information. 

You may have heard people talk about how awful pie charts are - that's because anything that can be put into a pie chart can also be put into a bar chart, which will be read more accurately. 
:::

## Optical Illusions

![](curve-difference.png)

::: notes

We're really bad at judging vertical distance, as well. If you need to show the difference between two curves, you should attempt to find a different way to do it than showing both curves on the same chart - for instance, plot the difference alongside the two curves.

:::

## Designing for Accessibility

- Write good alt-text and ensure it's included in your online work

- Low visual acuity:
    - High contrast (bright/dark)
    - large font size
    - textures/patterns can be hard to make out

- Colorblindness:
    - Safest: design for a black-and-white photocopier
    - Avoid rainbow gradients
    - If you need a 2-color gradient, use blue/purple - white - orange (safe for most types of colorblindness)
    
- Other options:
    - `ajrgodfrey/BrailleR` - translate plots into text descriptions for screen readers
    - `sonify` - represent data using sound
    - `gt` - tables with metadata that is easy for screen readers


::: notes

Unfortunately, there is relatively little research on other disabilities + statistical graphics
